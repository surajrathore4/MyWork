Me and My Partner made a Java Project for School management.
TO Run this Project Import it in your Java IDE, Install Mysql and Create a Database Named "School",and Create 5 tables in that database
with name: class_room, fees, salary, student, teacher.
columns:
class_room: room_number(int) | class(int) | total_students(int)
fees: roll_number(int) | class(int) | paid(varchar(4))
salary: name(varchar(40))  | Paid(varchar)
student: name(varchar(40)) | class(int) | Roll_number(int) | password(varchar(20)) | Marks(int)
teacher: name(varchar(40))  | class(int) | phone_number(int) | password(varchar(20)) | Salary(int)
assign all room Numbers to class in table class_room.
